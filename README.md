PRINCIPLES OF DOMAIN DRIVINE DESIGN(DDD)
1.Ubiquitous Language:
Speak the same language in code as you do in discussions.
Example: If you say "customer" in conversation, use "customer" in your code.
2.Bounded Context:
Clearly define boundaries for different parts of your system.
Example: Keep order-related terms separate from customer-related terms.
3.Aggregates:
Group related things together.
Example: If it's part of an order, keep items and customer info together.
4.Entities and Value Objects:
Entities have identity; Value Objects are defined by attributes.
Example: A person is an entity; an address is a value object.
5.Repositories:
Manage getting and storing grouped things.
Example: Handle finding and storing products if dealing with a "Products" group.
6.Services:
Use for operations that don't fit entities or value objects.
Example: Calculate shipping costs using a "ShippingService."
7.Domain Events:
Capture and represent important changes in the system.
Example: Trigger an "OrderPlaced" event when an order is made.
8.Modules:
 Organize code into clear parts based on business functions.
Example: Separate modules for inventory, orders, and customers instead of one big codebase.
                                           12-FACTORS PRINCIPLES
applications. Here's a concise summary of each factor:
1.Codebase:
One codebase per application, tracked in version control.
2.Dependencies:
Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies, use a package manager.
3.Config:
Store configuration in the environment, not in the code.
4.Backing Services:
Treat services (databases, queues) as attached resources.
5.Build, Release, Run:
Separate build, release, and run stages; strict versioning.
6.Processes:
Execute the app as one or more stateless processes.
7.Port Binding:
 Export services via port binding, and be ready to handle multiple instances.
8.Concurrency:
Scale out via the process model.
9.Disposability:
 Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown.
10.Dev/Prod Parity:
Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible.
11.Logs:
 Treat logs as event streams, write to standard output.
12.Admin Processes:
Run admin tasks as one-off processes separate from the main application.
                      MICROSERVICES ARCHIRECTURE
A microservices architecture is a type of application architecture where the application is developed as a collection of services. It provides the framework to develop, deploy, and maintain microservices architecture diagrams and services independently.
Advantages of Microservice Architecture:
Scalability:
Advantage: Easy to scale individual microservices independently based on demand.
Flexibility and Technology Diversity:
Advantage: Enables the use of different technologies and frameworks for each microservice, allowing teams to choose what fits best for their specific task.
Rapid Deployment and Continuous Delivery:
Advantage: Facilitates quicker deployment of individual microservices, enabling continuous delivery and faster time-to-market.
Isolation and Fault Tolerance:
Advantage: Failure in one microservice does not necessarily affect others, promoting fault isolation and improving system resilience.
Autonomous Development Teams:
Advantage: Teams can work independently on different microservices, fostering autonomy and parallel development.
Easy Maintenance and Upgrades:
Advantage: Easier to maintain and upgrade as changes are confined to specific microservices without affecting the entire system.
Technology Stack Diversity:
Advantage: Allows using the most suitable technology stack for each microservice, optimizing for specific requirements.
Scalability Across Development Teams:
Advantage: Enables multiple teams to work on different microservices concurrently, speeding up development.
Disadvantages of Microservice Architecture:
Complexity of Orchestration:
Disadvantage: Requires careful orchestration to manage communication and dependencies between microservices, adding complexity.
Increased Infrastructure Overhead:
Disadvantage: Managing multiple services can increase infrastructure overhead, especially in terms of monitoring, logging, and deployment.
Data Consistency Challenges:
Disadvantage: Maintaining data consistency across microservices can be challenging, especially in distributed systems.
Communication Overhead:
Disadvantage: Inter-service communication can introduce latency and may become a bottleneck, especially in a network-intensive environment.
Initial Development Cost:
Disadvantage: The initial development of microservices can be more complex and time-consuming compared to a monolithic architecture.
Testing Challenges:
Disadvantage: Comprehensive testing of microservices, especially in a distributed environment, can be challenging.
Security Concerns:
Disadvantage: Requires robust security measures, as the distributed nature of microservices can introduce new security challenges.
Operational Challenges:
Disadvantage: Operations and monitoring become more complex with a larger number of services, potentially requiring additional tooling and expertise.
                           MONOLITHIC ARCHITECTURE
A monolithic architecture is a singular, large computing network with one code base that couples all of the business concerns together.
Advantages of Monolithic Architecture:
Simplicity:
Advantage: Easier to develop and understand as all components are in one codebase.
Development Speed:
Advantage: Faster development since the entire application is built as a single unit.
Ease of Testing:
Advantage: Easier to test the entire application since all components are tightly integrated.
Simplified Deployment:
Advantage: Deployment is straightforward, involving the deployment of a single unit.
Efficient Resource Utilization:
Advantage: Requires less overhead compared to managing multiple services in a distributed environment.
Simplified Scaling:
Advantage: Scaling can be simpler since the entire application is scaled together.
Unified Technology Stack:
Advantage: All components use the same technology stack, simplifying development and maintenance.
Lower Operational Overhead:
Advantage: Fewer moving parts lead to lower operational complexity.

Limited Technology Diversity:
Disadvantage: Limited flexibility in choosing different technologies for different components.
Difficult Maintenance and Updates:
Disadvantage: Changes or updates may require redeployment of the entire application, leading to downtime.
Bottlenecks in Development:
Disadvantage: Larger codebase can lead to slower development and increased complexity.
Difficulty in Adopting New Technologies:
Disadvantage: It can be challenging to adopt new technologies or frameworks without a major overhaul.
Less Fault Isolation:
Disadvantage: Failure in one part of the application can affect the entire system.
Reduced Team Autonomy:
Disadvantage: Teams may need to coordinate closely when working on different parts of the application.
Increased Risk of Codebase Monolith:
Disadvantage: Over time, the codebase may become a monolith, making it harder to maintain and evolve.
